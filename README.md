Download Subtitles and Syncs the names

The moto of this app is to group two functionalities:

1) Downloading the subtitiles
2) Renaming the folders and subtitiles to a singel given name

Along with above operation thsi program should be doing below as well:

1) Before downloading subtitles check if already a SRT file exists (May be specifically English {Inclding in subfolders}), 
   if exists, it should not hit download and should just do renaming
2) Rename should rename the files as suggested an optionally reading a properties file to consider which junnk files to delete


Please not this program is being made for my personal use to dowload and rename the files to work on my Samsung television. 
Fell free to use it and exten its as required fro you.
